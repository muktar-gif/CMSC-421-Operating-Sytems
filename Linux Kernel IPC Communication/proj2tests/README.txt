In the mailboxTest.c file I test all of the syscalls created. I include all the system call functions in mailboxSyscalls.h. The file test bad syscalls in the beginning before creating any mailboxes, test file should output error codes in perror after each call. I then test creating the mailboxes, populating some of them with messages. I test receive and peek messages and how that affects the amount of messages in the mailbox. In the end of the test, I try the removing and reseting functions. One case to test removing mailboxes with messages and one case to remove mailboxes without messages. I then test reseting all mailboxes in the end.

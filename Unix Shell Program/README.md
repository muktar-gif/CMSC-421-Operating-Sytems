When I started the project I divided the problems given to us by the parts given, part 1 and part1. I then divided that work into the functions that are required for each part. In part 1, I need to set the get_user_function, I used the function fgetc that was suggested to use and did more research on how that fucntion is used (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/fgetc-fputc-c/). I then started on parse fucntion as it was the next required step for the project to work. I researched ways to split a string and found strtok(https://www.tutorialspoint.com/c_standard_library/c_function_strtok.htm). I incorportated strtok into splitting the command (try to do without strtok, was unsuccessful). All while routinely checking valgrind to make sure no errors or memory leak occur.

Next I began working on part 2, as it was a good way to test my parse function. I simply checked for proc and read into the file the user specified. I then finished including the exit command and refined the checking process for what the user entered to make sure of proper use of the commands. Lastly I did the execute function including a fork and executing the command if it did not fit as exit or proc. 

In the end I refined the look of my code and made sure I gave proper comments.
